Clustering Vs Classification 
Clustering:-
Type:used for unsupervised learning

Basic:grouping the instances based on their similarity 
      without the help of class labels

Need:there is no need of training and testing dataset

Complexity:less complex as compared to classification

Example Algorithms:k-means clustering algorithm, Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, 
                   Gaussian (EM) clustering algorithm, etc.
Example Scenario:Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior


Classification:-
Type:used for supervised learning

Basic:process of classifying the input instances 
      based on their corresponding class labels

Need:it has labels so there is need of training and 
     testing dataset for verifying the model created

Complexity:more complex as compared to clustering

Example Algorithms:Logistic regression, Naive Bayes classifier, Support vector machines, etc.

Example Scenario: Email spam detection



Regression Vs Classification

Regression:-
Type:used for supervised learning

Basic:Predict continuous numeric values

Complexity:Varies (can be simple or complex)

Example Algorithms:Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression

Example Scenario:House price prediction

Classification:-

Type:used for supervised learning

Basic:process of classifying the input instances 
      based on their corresponding class labels



Complexity: more complex as compared to clustering

Example Algorithms:Logistic regression, Naive Bayes classifier, Support vector machines, etc.

Example Scenario:Email spam detection
