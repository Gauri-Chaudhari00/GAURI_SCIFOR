1.Explain Encapsulation with example and write python code.
Answer:-Encapsulation is a fundamental object-oriented principle in Python. 
  It protects your classes from accidental changes or deletions and promotes code reusability and maintainability. 


2. Explain Polymorphism with example and write python code.
Answer:- Polymorphism means one thing existing in several different forms , 
and its also involves deciding at runtime which function form base class or derived class should get called.

3. Explain Single Level Inheritance with python code.
Answer:-Single-level inheritance is a type of inheritance where a child class inherits properties and behaviors or methods from another parent class.
       
4. Explain Multiple inheritance with python code.
Answer:-Multiple inheritance is class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. 
This allows a class to combine functionalities from multiple sources.

5. Explain Muti-level inheritance with python code
Answer:- Muti-level inheritance is When one class inherits another class it is further inherited by another class. It is known as multi-level inheritance

6. What do you mean by conditional statements. Explain with python code
Answer:-conditional statements is the statement where the code based on whether a specified condition is true or false

syntax: if-elif-else Statement:            if-else Statement:                        if Statement:        Nested if Statements:
	if.(condition1).....              if.(condition1).....                      if condition         if condition:
	.
	.
	elif.(condition2)		  else: The final code to be executed				 if condition:
	.
	.
	else: The final code to be executed								else:
													else: The final code to be executed

7. What do you mean by decision making statements. Explain with python code.
Answer:- decision making statements and conditional statements is the statement where the code based on whether a specified condition is true or false
syntax: if-elif-else Statement:            if-else Statement:                        if Statement:        Nested if Statements:
	if.(condition1).....              if.(condition1).....                      if condition         if condition:
	.
	.
	elif.(condition2)		  else: The final code to be executed				 if condition:
	.
	.
	else: The final code to be executed								else:
													else: The final code to be executed


9. What do you understand by Functions? Explain with python code.
Answer:- Functions in programming are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. functions are defined using the 'def' keyword


10. How many pillars of Oops we have in Python
Answer:- In oject-oriented programming (OOP) languages there are four pillers ,i.e Encapsulation,Polymorphism,Inheritance,Abstraction
