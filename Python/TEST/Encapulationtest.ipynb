        "Answer:-  Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).\n",
        "         It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit,\n",
        "          typically a class.\n",
        "          Encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers and getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\t\t      Encapsulation also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components,\n",
        "\t\t      which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the data.\n",
